## About

This plugin is a result of a question on twitter by
<a

href="https://twitter.com/Baconbrix/status/1470900742613467138">Evan Bacon</a>
and my impulsive nature

Started out as a simple hack and is now being used in no project (ha!),
it's still a very incomplete plugin as the name `mutable` is
a lot more complex than just converting a few variable to state hooks.

Anyhow, this is currently **WIP** and aggressively being
developed so if you do decide to use it, I'd consider using strict
version checks on your `package.json`
